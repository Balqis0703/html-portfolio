The Best Movies according to BOMAD's</h1>

<h2>My Top 4 movies of the year 2023.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>My Demon</h3>
<p>It's a Korean romance movie. I enjoyed every bit of it.</p>

<h3>Manifest</h3>
<p>My favourite of all time. The suspense gave me chills. I'm glad everything wasn't real afterall.</p>

<h3>Alchemy of Souls</h3>
<p>By now, you should know for sure I'm a Korean movies fan. And if you haven't seen this one, I'm concerned about what movies you've been watching then.</p>

<h3>The Woman King</h3>
<p>After waiting for so long, I was finally pushed to watch this movie and i must say, I have no regreats whatsoever. I love how it portrayed the African women.</p>
